# Learn to Hack 🥷

I come across a lot of resources when I am reading papers/blogs/resources for my studies. I will try to my best to organize them together here. It's not only about penetration testing, blue-teaming or red-teaming, I have also included links to resources where you can learn about cryptography and the maths behind it.
